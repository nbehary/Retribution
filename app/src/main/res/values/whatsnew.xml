    <string name="ver1.2.1">

        Version 1.3.0\n
        \n

        New Feature (Pro Version Only):\n
        - Items in folders can now be added/removed from a list of installed apps.  (or from groups) This is accessable from the menu on folders that really is a menu now.\n
\n
        Bug Fixes (Free and Pro as applicable):\n
        - Prevented a crash when Quick Scrolling in Widgets or the App Drawer.\n
        - App Drawer Sort menu shows the current sort mode rather than always showing "Install Time" regardless.\n
        - App Drawer Sort is actually saved in preferences now.\n
        - Long pressing All Apps and another Dock item no longer makes All Apps seemingly draggable which in turn caused the launcher to crash.\n
